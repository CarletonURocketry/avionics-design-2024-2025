\section{Previous Systems}

The previous year's avionics systems are used to guide this years designs. This section will briefly cover the flaws of
last year's systems to provide background on the decisions made this year.

\section{Software Design}

From a software perspective, last year's telemetry transmitter was very minimal in the quality of data that were
transmitted.

Transmitted packets contained data read directly from the onboard sensors, performing no additional sensor fusion to
measure different states of the rocket outside of using the altitude calculation suggested by the barometric pressure
sensor data sheet for combining temperature and pressure. This resulted in noisy measurements about rocket state, like
current altitude and angular velocity.

In addition, the system contained three sensors capable of measuring temperature. These sensors had a very high
measurement frequency, and were being read as fast as possible using a 1.5GHz clock speed on a Raspberry Pi 4. This
resulted in an overwhelming amount of temperature data being logged compared to other more important measurements such
as altitude, acceleration and GPS position. This also meant much of the data being sent was temperature data. The system
design guaranteed that GPS measurements would always be sent when measured because the GPS data was measured at only
10Hz, but this guarantee was never extended to other types of data.

The system was not robust in the way it handled failures. If the system had trouble detecting the EEPROM on the
I2C bus with startup configuration parameters, it would exit with a failure immediately instead of re-attempting to
connect or provide an external indication to the operator that something went wrong with the electrical connection (no
LED indication or buzzer, etc). This lack of robustness also applied to the radio process, which would fail if it could
not connected to the radio module over UART.

The system performed logging at its maximum frequency as soon as it was armed, which caused a significant amount of
memory to be used for logging while the rocket was sitting idle on the launch pad. Although memory was not scarce with
last year's system which used a large SD card, it did increase power consumption during the rocket's idle period. It is
also inconvenient to sift through logs taken while idle to get the actual flight data.

Finally, there was no indication of battery life ever implemented on this system. The driver for the current/voltage
sensor on-board was not completed in time for launch, so it was not possible to receive battery life warnings over
telemetry or through a visual indicator in the final system.
