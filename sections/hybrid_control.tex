\section{Hybrid Control System}

This year's hybrid control system is a completely new project for avionics with no prior system to inform its design.
The current working prototype is an Arduino based control system which has been difficult to maintain and use. The
system was designed using breadboard electronics and it is very difficult to organize the jumper wires or perform
repairs on the system. It also does not have the ability to detect connection interruptions, the user interface does not
update at the speed desired for monitoring the system and it has a tendency to crash spuriously. This prototype system
has sufficed for preliminary testing of the hybrid in cold flows, but must be updated for static fire testing and
launch.
