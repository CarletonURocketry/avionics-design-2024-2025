\section{Telemetry System}

This year's telemetry system aims to address the shortcomings in last year's design. The main flaws that are being
addressed are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Battery life status updates
    \item Power consumption
    \item System size for physical placement in the rocket
    \item Radio signal strength
    \item Enclosure integrity under shock load
    \item Lack of sensor fusion and equal data acquisition
    \item Use of memory for data logging while the rocket is idle
\end{itemize}
